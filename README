The files deposited here are the in-progress scripts I'm writing for my Summer of Code Project. They'll be full of comments to myself and possibly not run on other machines (let me know!). I'll get some Test Data on here too, in case you're interested. PS - I'm VERY new to GitHub and open source coding - if you have advice, I'd love to hear it!
The fasta folder is example input files. The lociInputMDB.py is the current script and the seqlite_mod.py is the script that is imported to lociInputMDB.py to count SNPS. Sorry everything is so ugly - I'm working on it!
