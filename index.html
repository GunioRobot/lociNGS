lociNGS: a simple database to display and reformat large multi-locus datasets

This program is the project I wrote for Google Summer Of Code 2011 under guidance from Jeremy Brown and Brad Chapman with NESCent. It is written in Python and uses MongoBD for it's databasing functions. Please feel free to contact me with any issues.
