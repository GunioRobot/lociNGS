INSTALLATIONThe program is dependent on several other pieces of software. lociNGS was written on MacOSX. You will have to install 5 components to run the program but they should all be relatively easy if you are familiar with very basic UNIX commands (like “cd”). The five components are MongoDB (the database program that will store your data) and four Python-related pieces: NumPy, Biopython, Pymongo and Pysam. 1.1 MongoDB1.1.1 Installation of MDBGo to www.mongodb.org/downloads ; download correct version (if you don’t know if your machine is 32 or 64 bit, see next section).Double click the downloaded file – this should unpack it into a folder called something like “mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.8.2”.Move the MongoDB folder to Applications (or wherever you want to keep it). You will need mongod to be running every time you use lociNGS, so you should remember where you put the MongoDB folder.Make the directory that stores the data by opening a terminal and typing “mkdir –p /data/db” (without the quotations)Go to the mongoDB folder, then the bin folder. Double click mongod. This should open a screen with something like this:Last login: Wed Aug  3 08:12:53 on ttys001/Applications/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.8.1/bin/mongod ; exit;HappyPappy:~ shird$ /Applications/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.8.1/bin/mongod ; exit;/Applications/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.8.1/bin/mongod --help for help and startup optionsWed Aug  3 09:13:53 [initandlisten] MongoDB starting : pid=11886 port=27017 dbpath=/data/db/ 64-bit Wed Aug  3 09:13:53 [initandlisten] db version v1.8.1, pdfile version 4.5Wed Aug  3 09:13:53 [initandlisten] git version: a429cd4f535b2499cc4130b06ff7c26f41c00f04Wed Aug  3 09:13:53 [initandlisten] build sys info: Darwin erh2.10gen.cc 9.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 9.6.0: Mon Nov 24 17:37:00 PST 2008; root:xnu-1228.9.59~1/RELEASE_I386 i386 BOOST_LIB_VERSION=1_40Wed Aug  3 09:13:53 [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017Wed Aug  3 09:13:53 [websvr] web admin interface listening on port 280171.1.2 How to tell if your computer is 32- or 64-bit (from support.apple.com/kb/ht3696)1. Choose About This Mac from the Apple () menu in the upper-left menu bar, then click More Info.2. Open the Hardware section.3. Locate the Processor Name [under the Hardware Overview].4. Compare your Processor Name to information below to determine whether your Mac has a 32-bit or 64-bit processor.Processor Name		32- or 64-bitIntel Core Solo		32 bitIntel Core Duo		32 bitIntel Core 2 Duo		64 bitIntel Quad-Core Xeon	64 bitDual-Core Intel Xeon		64 bitQuad-Core Intel Xeon	64 bitCore i3			64 bitCore i5			64 bitCore i7			64 bit1.2 Python and necessary modules1.2.1 Python installationMacOSX should come with a version of Python already installed. If you’re not sure Python is on your machine:In an open terminal, type “python”. This should display something like “Python 2.7.1 (r271:86882M, Nov 30 2010, 10:35:34)” plus a couple of other lines of text followed by “>>>”. Type “exit()”.If the above did not happen, go to www.python.org/getit/ for Python installation.1.2.2 NumPy  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/ (they have an automated installer, download the file, double click, follow instructions)For more information: http://www.scipy.org/Download1.2.3 Biopython - http://biopython.org/wiki/Download; download, double click, move the folder into the home directory, open terminal window, cd into folder, type three commands: [1] “python setup.py build”, [2] “python setup.py test”, [3] “sudo python setup.py install”1.2.4 Pymongo - https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver; click “Downloads” button (upper-ish right of screen); click “1.11”;  once it downloads, rename the folder “pymongo”, put the folder in the home directory, cd into it, and type “python setup.py install”For more information, other installation options: http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html1.2.5 Pysam - http://code.google.com/p/pysam/downloads/list; download file, double-click, move folder into Applications folder (or where you’d like to keep it), cd into folder and type two commands: [1] “python setup.py build”, [2] “python setup.py install”1.2.6 seqlite_mod.py – this module is included with the distribution and you should have to do nothing to compile or install it.2. EASY INSTALLworking on it!3. INPUT FORMATSlociNGS uses three imports. [1] The first is a folder of files that contain loci in fasta format. These files should have “.fasta” as their extension. The folder may be located anywhere.[2] The second import is a folder of indexed bam files from a short read aligner. Each bam (and corresponding .bai) file should correspond to an individual in the dataset. I’m working on getting sam format to work too, but for right now, indexed bam works best.[3] The third is a tab-delimited text file that contains demographic data for the individuals in the dataset. There must be at least two columns, labeled “Individual” and “Population”, which contain information on the name of the individual (as it appears in locus files and BAM file names) and which population the individual came from (these can be numbers or letters). The file may contain as many columns as you’d like, they will appear on the “Summary Screen” of the program.*lociNGS will run and reformat loci if just [1] loci and [3] demographic data are entered. 4. TO RUN lociNGS:4.1 Contents of the folderI think it’s easiest to keep everything in one place, but you don’t necessarily have to. The reformatted NEXUS output files will be written to the directory where the locus files are. The IMa2 and MIGRATE output files will be written to the directory where the menu.py (and other scripts) are, presumably a lociNGS folder. You need the following components in the lociNGS folder in order to run it:	1.  constructionMDB.py	2.  convertingLociNGS.py	3.  menu.py	4.  seq_lite.py	5.  locus folder of fasta files*	6.  BAM and BAI folder*	7.  Tab-delimited text file of demographic data* 	8.  IMa2 input file (if formatting for IMa2 or Migrate, format described below)[After the program is run for the first time, an additional four files will appear with the extension .pyc (for each of the python scripts above). These can be removed but are used to speed up the running of python scripts.]4.2 Starting the programMongoDB must be running before lociNGS is started. To do this, you can find the MongoDB folder with Finder, then go into the bin folder and double click “mongod”. Alternatively, from the terminal, you can cd into the MongoDB folder, then cd into “bin” and type “./mongod”. Leave the window open and when you are finished with lociNGS YOU MUST EXIT MONGOD BY PRESSING CONTROL and “c” TOGETHER. If you forget to do this, the mongod process will be improperly shut down and not start the next time you need it. If that happens (it is easy to fix),see below.To run the program, open a terminal window and cd into lociNGS folder. Then type “python menu.py”. This should open a new window with these basic instructions: “Please enter the data in the order listed in the Import Menu. Once data has been loaded via the Import Menu, press ‘Display the data’.” Don’t close this window – it will close the program.5. IMPORTING DATA5.1 Loci/fasta file(s)This will open a window where you should find and select the locus folder. The terminal window will print data as the files are read (but the lociNGS window will do nothing). It should be a lot of text that looks something like: “Got this file:  /Users/shird/Desktop/juncoLoci/JUNCOmatic_63_aln.fastalocusFasta =  JUNCOmatic_63_aln.fasta ; individuals {'J12': 0, 'J09': 0, 'J18': 0, 'J19': 0, 'J01': 0, 'J17': 0, 'J03': 0, 'J11': 0, 'J05': 0, 'J04': 0, 'J10': 0, 'J06': 0} ; indInFasta ['J12', 'J09', 'J18', 'J19', 'J01', 'J17', 'J03', 'J11', 'J05', 'J04', 'J10', 'J06'] ; SNPs =  5 ; number alleles =  24 ; length =  284 ; path =  /Users/shird/Desktop/juncoLoci/JUNCOmatic_63_aln.fasta”5.2 SAM/BAM NGS dataThis will open a window where you should find and select the indexed bam folder. The terminal window will print data as the files are read. It will look something like this for each file: “Got this folder: /Users/shird/Documents/Dropbox/juncoBamGot this file:  /Users/shird/Documents/Dropbox/juncoBam/J01.sorted.bam730individuals.J01”5.1.3 Demographic dataThis will open a window where you should find and select the tab delimited demographic data file. Again, the terminal will print data for each individual as the files are read:“{'Longitude': '-109.876', 'Individual': 'J01', 'Location': 'NoPlace, TX', 'Latitude': '45.678', 'Species': 'Junco hyemalis', 'Population': 'POP1'}POP1”6. THE lociNGS INTERFACElociNGS only has two screens meant to show you how much data is associated with each individual in your dataset. The first screen is a summary screen where each individual is a row and the demographic data are the columns. There is also a “numLoci” column that displays the number of loci called for that particular individual. If you click one of these numLoci buttons, a second screen appears that displays the specific loci. On this screen there are five columns:Locus Name = the locus file/locus nameLength = length of the locusCoverage_This_Ind = how many raw reads from this individual aligned to the locus. If this button is pressed, a fasta file is generated that contains these reads. This file will be printed to the directory that contains the lociNGS scripts. Number_Inds = how many individuals are present in the locus fileCoverage_Total = how many raw reads from any individual aligned to the locus. If this button is pressed, a fasta file that contains the reads is generated and printed to the lociNGS directory.7. EXPORTING DATAYou may export data in three formats (NEXUS, IMa2 and MIGRATE) and you may select either specific individuals from your dataset you’d like to include in your files OR you may select a set of populations. If you select populations, lociNGS will scan the locus files for any locus that contains at least one individual from each of the selected populations are will reformat these loci.7.1 NEXUS formatNEXUS format requires aligned data. Files will be printed to the directory containing the locus files and will have a “.nex” extension.7.2 IMa2 formatIMa2 requires an additional input file to describe some of the dataset specific parameters. I’ve included an example file. Please see IMa2 manual (available at http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/ProgramsandData/Programs/IMa2/Using_IMa2_10_13_10.pdf) for more information on the parameters.The IMa2 extra parameters file must be named “IMa2InputFile.txt” and should follow the format of the included IMa2InputFile format – just type the values you need after the colon.Header Line: Type whatever you want here that will identify your IMa runPopulation Tree: ((0,1):5,(2,3):4):6Inheritance Scalar: 1Mutation Model: HMutation Rate (optional): 0.008Mutation Rate Range Lower (optional): 0.0007Mutation Rate Range Upper (optional): 0.0009If you aren’t using the Mutation Rate Parameters, delete them from the file. If you are, please note that the mutation rate you enter needs to be the XXX mutation rate, lociNGS will divide it by the length of each locus to give a PER BASE mutation rate (which is what the program requires). Also note that the Population Tree is required and is a very specific format, so please check with the IMa2 documentation for how to write it.7.3 Migrate formatMigrate format requires that an IMa2 additional file be in the folder, but doesn’t use the information – so if you just need Migrate output, leave the example IMa2InputFile.txt in the folder as is.	8. TEST DATAI’ve included a very small test dataset, containing four individuals and five loci. 9.
